ðŸŽ¯Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

The basic requirements for HTML, CSS and JS my level specific to the assignment have been achieved by adhering to the fundamental knowledge and basic coding skills learned during the two weeks of intensive study.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?Â Â 

ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks? Â Many example codes were provided as part of the course syllabus, but efficiently applying and structuring them has been challenging, despite focusing on the logic (for JS). I noticed those with programming background in the class, write much shorter code than beginners, and their code structures differ significantly from the examples demonstrated and shared to us for HTML and CSS in particular.
