My Gallery

1. What went really well and what could have gone better?

Learning multiple concepts in just one week was challenging for someone with little to no coding background. However, in the second week, I gained a much clearer understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.

It was an achievement (though small) to be able to set up the HTML and CSS tags by myself for the most part, to create a simple gallery.

2. Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials). I had to back read and review week 1 lessons to get a much better understanding of the concepts that are needed to create a gallery. I didn't use Youtube tutorials. The references on Moodle are reliable resources, that help me aid in narrowing down and simplifying the concept for an improved application of theories into practice.  I learn better with real life analogy approach to a highly technical learning - self-assessment and reflection, designing a learning framework that suits me is part of my overall plan.

I always hear in the class that for any questions consult Google. I believe relying heavily on Google posed some great danger where examples or solutions might be outdated. There are instances where I get the incorrect solutions leading to inefficient code. It also eat up much of your time validating which solutions will work. I prefer to read the resources provided by Tech Ed based on the understanding that all these resources have undergone a thorough review by the experts.

2. Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment. Error always points to undefined tags especially in JS.
